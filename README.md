## Introduction
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It treats object detection as a single regression problem, making it efficient and fast. This implementation uses:
- **Darknet**: An open-source neural network framework written in C and CUDA.
- **YOLOv3 Pre-trained Weights**: For detecting objects like cars, dogs, and other common items in images.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash```

```git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet```

```cd darknet```



### Step 2: Compile Darknet
Make sure you have a C compiler installed. To compile darknet, run the following command:

bash

Copy code

```make```

### Step 3: Download YOLOv3 Weights


To use the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights, run:

```bash```

Copy code
```wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights```

### Usage

## Running Object Detection

To detect objects in an image using YOLOv3, run the following command:

```bash```

Copy code

```./darknet detect cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights data/<image_name>.jpg```

Replace <image_name> with the name of the image you want to analyze. For example, dog.jpg.

This command will detect objects in the image, and the processed image with bounding boxes will be saved as predictions.jpg.

## Example Outputs

# Sample Command

To detect objects in an image, run:

```bash```

Copy code

```./darknet detect cfg/yolov3.cfg yolov3.weights data/dog.jpg```

## Output Example

The output will be displayed in the terminal like this:

makefile

Copy code

```dog: 99%```

```car: 90%```

```bicycle: 78%```

The processed image will be saved as predictions.jpg, showing detected objects with bounding boxes.

### Viewing the Results

You can use Python to open and display the output image:

python

Copy code

```from PIL import Image```

# Open and display the image with detected objects

```img = Image.open("predictions.jpg")```

```img.show()```
